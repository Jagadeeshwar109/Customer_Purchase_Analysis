**Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis**
**Project Overview**
This project performs an end-to-end analysis of customer shopping data to identify trends in purchasing behavior, customer loyalty, discount usage, and product performance. The objective is to transform raw transactional data into structured business insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

**Dataset**
The dataset contains customer demographics, purchase details, product categories, pricing, ratings, discounts, shipping types, and subscription information. It was preprocessed in Python to handle missing values, standardize columns, remove redundancies, and create engineered features such as age groups and purchase frequency in days.

**Tools & Technologies**
Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning, transformation, and EDA
SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL) – Analytical querying and aggregation
Power BI – Interactive dashboards and visualization.

**Workflow**
Raw data was cleaned and processed using Python.
The transformed dataset was exported to a SQL database.
Business queries were written to analyze customer behavior and revenue.
SQL results were connected to Power BI for visualization and reporting.

**Key Analysis Areas**
Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)
Revenue by gender and age group
Subscription vs non-subscription spending
Discount-driven purchases
Top products and category performance
Repeat buyer behavior

**Power BI Dashboard**
The Power BI dashboard presents key business metrics including total revenue, customer segments, discount impact, product performance, and subscription analysis through interactive visualizations and filters.
Outcome
This project provides a complete retail analytics solution, enabling businesses to understand customer behavior, optimize marketing strategies, and improve sales performance using data-driven insights.
